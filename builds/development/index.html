			<article id="info">
				<section id="community" class="about-kgb">
					<p>CrossFit KGB is a community of people of all ages who are committed to constantly improving our strength, balance, agility, endurance, and flexibility. From this, we lead quality lives of independence and functional fitness. We focus on function and performance, not body image. We support each other as we enhance our abilities and improve our fitness levels by being challenged in high-intensity, constantly-varied functional movements. We are mothers, fathers, grandparents, and children. We are accountants, firefighters, teachers and doctors. We are the top athlete in our school and we have never played sports before. We are strong and we are committed to ourselves and to our community.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="components" class="about-kgb">
					<p>We are a CrossFit-dedicated gym located in beautiful Kennebunk, Maine. We provide a high-intensity core strength and conditioning program that focuses on all ten components of optimal physical fitness that CrossFit embodies:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance – the ability of the body systems to gather, process, and transport oxygen</li>
						<li>Stamina – the ability of the body to process, store, deliver, and utilize energy</li>
						<li>Strength – the ability of a muscular unit, or combo of muscular units to apply force</li>
						<li>Flexibility – the ability of maximizing range of motion at a given joint</li>
						<li>Power – the ability of a muscular unit, or combo of muscular units to apply maximum force in minimum time</li>
						<li>Speed – the ability to minimize the time cycle of a repeated movement</li>
						<li>Agility – the ability to minimize transition time between one movement pattern to another</li>
						<li>Coordination – the ability to combine several distinct movement patterns into a singular distinct movement</li>
						<li>Balance – the ability to control the placement of the bodies center of gravity in relation to its support base</li>
						<li>Accuracy – the ability to control movement in a given direction or at a given intensity</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="about-crossfit">
					<p class="quote">"CrossFit is the principal strength and conditioning program for many police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide.
						Our program delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing. Combat, survival, many sports, and life reward this kind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist.
						The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We've used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. We scale load and intensity; we don't change programs.
						The needs of Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree not kind. Our terrorist hunters, skiers, mountain bike riders and housewives have found their best fitness from the same regimen.</p>

				<h1>Classes</h1>
			</article>
			<article class="content">
				<p>In all classes at CrossFit KGB, one word will always stand out: function. Everything we do relates to helping make the human body function more effectively and safely. All of the classes listed below can be taken by everyone, no matter the level of fitness. Each class will be sensitive to the needs and abilities of its participants. You will be challenged – safely – to the best of your ability.</p>
				<section id="foundations">
					<h1>CrossFit Foundations/Skill</h1>
					<p>It is mandatory that members new to CrossFit become familiar with the basic exercises and movements that will be used in the workouts. In this program, you will have an opportunity to develop a base level of fitness and understanding of the following:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Nutritional foundations</li>
						<li>Posture, flexibility and core strength</li>
						<li>Bodyweight movements</li>
						<li>External resistance exercises</li>
						<li>Basic gymnastics and calisthenics</li>
						<li>Olympic Weightlifting</li>
						<li>Kettlebell exercises</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Once you've completed the Foundation/Skill, you're ready to move on, to join the regular group classes and continue to gain strength and flexibility – to make your body function as it was designed.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="group-class">
					<h1>Regular Group Class</h1>
					<img src="images/group_class.jpg" alt="Group Class">
					<p>Regular group classes are for people who have a basic understanding of the CrossFit movements and are ready to safely incorporate them into more complex workouts. You must have completed the Foundations Program before participating in group classes, but all movements are scalable and can be modified during group classes to accommodate all levels.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="ais">
					<h1>Active Isolated Stretching</h1>
					<p>Active Isolated Stretching is a class that is designed to stretch all of the muscles in your body in a class that is sensitive to the level of each individual participant. At each class, Ben will ask if there are any specific areas of discomfort you're dealing with and will ensure that the stretches done in that class will address your needs. We offer two Active Isolated Stretching classes each week. Whether the first time you've exercised in years, or someone who is actively fit, this class will help you make your body function more effectively, safely and without pain. You will be amazed at how quickly your body will gain flexibility – and flexibility gives you strength!</p>

					<h2>Ben Vernon</h2>
					<img src="images/ben.jpg" alt="Coach Ben">
					<p>Ben spent 17 years between the Coast Guard and the Merchant Marines, and first started incorporating CrossFit into his life in 2004. He found CrossFit to be the perfect variety of exercises for someone who, when at sea, was without the traditional tools found in a mainstream gym. When not at sea, CrossFit proved to be the perfect compliment both physically and mentally to Ben's passion for and practice of mixed martial arts. Soon, the mainstream gym no longer provided the environment that has proven to help Ben meet his strength and wellness goals.</p>
					<p>Since May of 2011, Ben has obtained his CrossFit Level 1 Training certificate as well as CrossFit certifications in Mobility, Olympic Lifting, and CrossFit Kids. He coaches multiple daily group classes and continues his massage therapy business, which provides an integral piece of the wellness puzzle. Ben is familiar with and passionate about the way the human body works in all levels of fitness and stages of aging. CrossFit KGB is the perfect environment for him to share what he knows and support his community by offering instruction, guidance, and opportunity for everyone to become their best, strongest, selves.</p>

					<h2>Lia Langeveld</h2>
					<img src="images/lia.jpg" alt="Coach Lia">
					<p>Lia is a CF-L1 trainer as well as being CrossFit Kids certified. She has trained at CrossFit KGB since June of 2011 and worked here since May of 2012. Growing up in Massachusetts, Lia swam competitively on a club team and played JV Soccer, Varsity Swimming and Varsity Track and Field. Lia attended Wheaton College in Norton MA and graduated with a Political Sociology major and a Philosophy minor. After college, Lia was head coach of YMCA swim teams in Lima, Ohio and Biddeford, Maine before becoming head coach of her current team in Portland, Maine.</p>

						<p>I found CrossFit by chance. After taking AIS classes for a few months, I started taking CrossFit classes. I’d always preferred working out on my own and had been sporadic at best since graduating. I could listen to my iPod and just tune everything out; but these workouts were different - I needed to be present. Instantly hooked, I realized just how out of shape I was that first summer. I couldn’t even do an air squat when I started. Each day was a new set of challenges and new skills to work on.</p>
						<p>Eventually, I found it easier to breathe during workouts - then, I learned it was time to push harder. My nerves started to be replaced with excitement for what each new day would bring.</p>
						<p>Before I could realize it, CrossFit had bled over into other areas of my life. From the outside in, it looks like a bunch of people doing workouts with weights, pullups, pushing sleds or doing lots of squats. From the inside, you realize that these are some of the most genuine, amazing people that you’ve ever met. They become your family and they celebrate your triumphs and take care of you through some of the hardest days of your life.</p>
						<p>Coaching at KGB has allowed me to see people in many different lights. My favorite thing is watching someone get a new box jump height, kick into a handstand for the first time, get a double under or achieve something that they didn’t think they could do. I’ve watched as friendships developed and have heard again and again how people have made positive changes in their lives and the lives of others. Every day, I get to see people pushing to the best of their ability and giving it their all and I absolutely love being a part of it!</p>
